                                <h3>Dear SoKo,</h3>
                                <p>I am writing this letter to express my sincere apologies. I understand that my actions have caused you inconvenience, discomfort, or hurt, and for that, I am truly sorry. I regret that I let things escalate to a point where they caused harm to our relationship.
                                   
                                   <br/>As a gesture of my genuine apology, I would like to invite you to lunch/dinner at Capella. It is a beautiful place with a serene atmosphere that I believe will provide us with the right ambiance to discuss and resolve any issues we might have. I want to make things right between us, and I believe that a lunch/dinner would be a great way to do so.
                                    
                                     <br/>Capella is an exceptional restaurant that offers a diverse range of dishes, and I am confident that you will enjoy the experience.
                                    
                                     <br/>Please let me know if this idea sounds appealing to you, and we can set a date and time that works for you. I assure you that I am committed to making things right and restoring our friendship.
                                    
                                     <br/>Once again, I am sorry for any harm that I have caused, and I look forward to the opportunity to make amends over lunch/dinner at Capella.</p>
                                <p>Sincerely,<br/>Aayush</p>
